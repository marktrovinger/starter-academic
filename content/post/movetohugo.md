title: Move to Hugo
summary: Why I moved to site to Hugo

You may have noticed that my site looks very different than it used to. I decided to move both my site and blog over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), partly due to my dissatisfaction with my old blogging software and my desire to make a more
professional looking site as I get ready to start graduate school in Fall 2021.

Part of my dissatisfaction with the old setup, which used the fastai template, is it felt very fragile; I constantly felt like I was going to break something with no hope of being able to get it back. I also felt like it wasn't a great way to demonstrate projects I was working on.

As you can see from the site as it sits right now, I have numerous small updates that need to be made, such as updating all of the cards that discuss what my research and career interests are.
