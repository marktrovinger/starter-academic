You may have noticed that my site looks very different than it used to. I decided to move both my site and blog over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), partly due to my dissatisfaction with my old blogging software and my desire to make a more
professional looking site as I get ready to start graduate school in Fall 2021.
