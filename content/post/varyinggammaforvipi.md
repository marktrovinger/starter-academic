# Introduction
I have been reading *Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning* by Miguel Morales as part of an ultralearning project to fill any gaps in knowledge I might have about reinforcement learning. While this isn't a book review, I can say that the book is very well written and does a good job of communicating the concepts in a way that is easier to understand than a book like Sutton and Barto. 

At the end of each chapter are tasks that deepen understanding of the topics covered in that chapter, and the third chapter of the book covers the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term goals. The concept of policy iteration, where the actions an agent takes in a given state are evaluated and through iteration a more optimal policy is discovered, is discussed, as is value iteration #TODO: expand on this#. A crucial variable in both value and policy iteration is gamma, a variable that discounts future rewards in favor of immediate returns. One of the tweet tasks at the end of the chapter is to examine the results of varying gamma in both value and policy iteration, which this post will examine.
