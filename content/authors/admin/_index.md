I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue Fort Wayne. I am interested in the many forms of artificial intelligence, including but not limited to, deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. I have strong skills in Python, focused mainly on both the data science stack in Python and deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch.
