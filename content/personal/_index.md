Trumpet playing is one of my passions, especially classical and baroque music. I have most recently played in the Purdue Fort Wayne Community Orchestra, shown here is the trumpet section for the 2019 Christmas concert.

I am a Boilermaker through and through, both my wife and I graduated from Purdue University and I plan to attend Purdue for my PhD at the conclusion of my MS.
